### Restricting Connecting Interfaces

Sometime you would like to make sure that the spot has right interfaces as expected.

You can pass a JSON-Schema to `expect` option when accessing an interface.
If the interface does not conform to the schema, it throws an error.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-restrict.js'}}}
```
