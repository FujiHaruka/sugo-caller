### Restrict the connecting interface

Sometime you would like to make sure that the spot has right interface as expected.

You can pass a json schema to `expect` to options when accessing a interface.
If the interface does not conform to the schema, it throws an error.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-restrict.js'}}}
```
